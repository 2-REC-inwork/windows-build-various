GIFLIB WINDOWS BUILD

- Extract the giflib source in a directory at the same level as "giflib_win", and rename it "giflib"

- Install CLang tools for Visual Studio 2019

- Open the solution in VS2019

- Open "gif_font.c" and add the following at the beginning (after "gif_lib.h" include):

#ifdef _MSC_VER
#define strtok_r strtok_s
#endif

  (TODO: this is mandatory for the shared build, for static build there is only a warning - is it required?)

- Can switch between static or shared builds by changing the project type in the configuration.
  To build OIIO, it seems that the static build is expected.
