- copy generated files in external location
- Solve how to make DLL with export symbols - need to modify code?
Can add rule in makefile:
```
dll: $(OBJS)
	$(CC) /D_USRDLL /D_WINDLL $(OBJS) /MT /link /DLL /out:libbz2.dll
```
but symbols are not exported in the DLL (there i however a "DEF" file provided...)
