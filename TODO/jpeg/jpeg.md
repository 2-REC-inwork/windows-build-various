# JPEG

Either the classic 'libJPEG' or 'libJPEG-Turbo'.

  * libJPEG-Turbo
    Download from the [libjpeg-turbo](https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo) GitHub repository.
    Tag 2.1.1 is the version used here.

    Build instructions:
    ```batch
    cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64 "%LIBJPEG_SRC_PATH%"
    ```
    (The environment must be previously initialised by executing the 'vcvars' script)

    This will generate the Visual Studio project files.
    Open 'ALL_BUILD.vcxproj' in Visual Studio, and build the project (select the desired build configuration).
    The following command can also be used to build the libraries without opening VS:
    ```batch
    cmake --build . --target install
    ```
    (When using in other projects, need to link the "turbojpeg-static.lib" library)




  * JPEG
TODO: check build process+script again => should have 'build+install' (?)
    Download the source archive from the [Independent JPEG Group](http://www.ijg.org/).
    Version 9d is used here.
    Information about the library and build can be found in 'install.txt' inside the archive.

    To prepare the build, execute the following command in the jpeg directory:
    ```batch
    nmake -f makefile.vs setup-v16
    ```
    (The environment must be previously initialised by executing the 'vcvars' script)

    This will generate the Visual Studio solutions and project files.
    To build the jpeg library, open 'jpeg.sln' in Visual Studio, and build the solution ('Release 64 bits' configuration).

    The following include files are required by projects using the JPEG library:
    (TODO: CHECK WHICH INCLUDE FILES TO KEEP!?!)
    - jpeglib.h
    - jmorecfg.h
    - jerror.h
    Additionally, the following files are generated by the configuration/pre-build process:
      - jconfigint.h
      - jconfig.h
